## Database- MongoDb
I choosed mongodb over other databases, because this can handle the unstructured data in a very effective manner, if in future, we were extending the app to add a picture of a contact, it can be in a good way in mongodb.

## Challenges
During the development, I faced a challenge in the editing functionality and to check that user doesn't enter empty fields, I resolved this by going through GFG articles and through some youtube videos.
